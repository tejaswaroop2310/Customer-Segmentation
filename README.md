# Online Retail Customer Segmentation 

## Project Intro/Objective
We live in a world where large and vast amount of data is collected daily. Analyzing such data is an important need. In the modern era of innovation, where there is a large competition to be better then everyone, the business strategy needs to be according to the modern conditions. The concept of which customer segment to target is done using the customer segmentation process using the clustering technique. 


### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Visualization
* Cohort Analysis
* Cluster Analysis
* RFM Analysis


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib


## Project Description
In this project, we have to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers


__Data preparation__ : In this step, we define the sources of data, define data schemas and tables, understand the main characteristics of the data, clean the dataset, delete non-relevant datasets, transform the data, and divide the data into required chunks for analysis.<br> <br>
__Data analysis__ :  The main tasks involve summarizing the data, finding the hidden correlation and relationships among the data. Some of the techniques used for data summarization are summary tables, graphs, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, correlation statistics.<br> <br>
__Data Visualizations__ : This is  an essential step as the result analysed from the dataset should be interpretable by the business stakeholders, which is one of the major goals of EDA. Most of the graphical analysis techniques include scattering plots, character plots, histograms,residual plots, mean plots, and others. We will explore several types of graphical representations
__Cohort Analysis__ : Cohort analysis is a descriptive analytics tool. It groups the customers into mutually exclusive cohorts - which are then measured over time. Cohort analysis provides deeper insights than the so-called vanity metrics. It helps with understanding the high-level trends better by providing insights on metrics across both the product and the customer lifecycle
__RFM Analysis__: We analysed the data using Recency, Frequency, Monetary Metrics to Analyse the customer behaviour how they are interacting with products and services

##Conclusion:
-	85 % of the transactions are done from United Kingdom
-	Orders are more in November month compared to other months
-	Cohort Analysis helps observe the retention rate of the customers
